## Rapport CMS assignment

This document will serve as my CMS Rapport, 
throughout the document I will detail my coding choices and the wordpress process I went through in this project, 
this rapport will be a short one as the work I did was fast and easy, though I did make a mistake or two along the way.

Mistake number one was my confusion around the cms, I fumbled a bit in where to make my content, but when I put the pieces together it was quite straight forward, I don't know if I am correct as I haven't tested that yet but another mistake I made I think was that I did not just make my content on flywheel from the get go, 
so instead I made it in local and pushed it to flywheel, when in theory it looked to me that I just could have made the content in flywheel, you live you learn.

after I got flywheel up and running it was a pretty simple process of making an API call to my cms and displaying the content on my first semester project site,
The content itself is just lorem ipsum. 

On this project I know i did the bare minimum as my mind is already firmly fixed on the upcoming semester exam, I did as the brief stated and have the following done:

- have installed WordPress on a web host and created a list of blogs
- be making an API call to fetch the blogs to your cross-course project
- be using query strings to let the user click to view an individual product.


In case you get redirected to the homepage of the site I will state here that the cms course assignment delivery is the research publications link in the footer of my site, but I have also posted a direct link above the report.
Overall a cool assignment, I have a lot of ideas that will absolutely need a cms, so this was quite helpful to my personal projects.
