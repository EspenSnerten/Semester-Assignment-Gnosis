This was my first year Christmas semester assignment, the task was to build a website for a science museum.

in the brief we got it was stated that the project should appeal to all ages and families with kids.

## Description

The research phase I went through in this project was mainly finding inspiration for my design, I was not in need of approval for various vital parts of the project because I was the only one working on this, 
that meant that the starting phase really did not include all that much  detailed planning, I set my goals and mainly followed a daily to-do list, I did construct a gantt chart, 
but during the course of the assignment I ended up defaulting to my trusty to-do list witch I use in other parts of my daily life, 
this was a mistake as my time management suffered because of this, a valuable lesson learned, 
just because it work's in my daily life thus not constitute that it will work on a project. 

The design phase for me was a bit frustrating this time, certain parts I loved and my creative process was in a good flow, but when I hit that creative wall I felt really stuck, 
so much so that I ended up taking a break from the project for a day, this is also a very valuable lesson, this for me highlights the one thing I do have control over when it comes to creativity and that is perseverance, 
and i will absolutely work on this from now on.

All but one of the images I used in the project was gathered from unsplash, I felt this was a good choice as it gave my media profile a certain structure both in looks and references wise, the fonts I used was sourced from 1001fonts.com.
I did a cool thing where I designed a basic geometric shape and put a cool font with a word that has relevance to the project and that was how my name and profile for the page was born, 
I have included an option I was considering for the name of the site as well as the logo in the figma file, I will further detail the profile of the site in my conclusion,
Structurally the site follows perhaps a little too safe a pastern, and had I had more confidence in my coding ability's I would have included a lot more scenes to the site as time constraint's was something I was wary of,
 it is not an excuse, I had after all a month for this project, but I really wanted the pages I did go for to be so much better than the last time.

The stand out pages in my opinion is the “shop” page and the “home” page, these I felt came out real nice and the aesthetics made sense, one really cool thing I did with the “shop” page is that I used a website were you can print logo's on different objects and used that as my souvenirs, thus I was able to present a structured souvenir shop that looked professional.  

The “contact” page and “about” page is really nothing special but they do look nice as well, the same unfortunately can not be said about the collection and ticket page, and these were of course the pages I had a lot of trouble designing and it reflects on the aesthetics of the page, of course now that I am at the end of my project I have several ideas that could be cool but alas no time to implement them, this is a hundred percent on me and my poor time management. 

The coding process this time set in contrast to earlier projects went a lot smoother, I learned from my previous mistakes and improved upon what I did right last time, this resulted in a site that is responsive and works almost universally on different devices, I still have a way to go when it comes to the clamp function, but I am working on it.

I used flex where I felt it appropriate and even included grids, which for me was a function I struggled with on the last assignment and ended up not using that time, 
so for me that I was able to not only use grids where it made sense but also clamp on the text is a major improvement.

Another thing I felt I did right is that I worked with percentages and viewport width, this was also a pretty major improvement and really made a difference when it came to responsiveness.
What I did wrong however is that I once again coded the wrong way, I struggled to wrap my head around  beginning with mobile view when coding, huge room for improvement there, 
I also have some work to do when it comes to structuring my css, but in my opinion it is a lot better than last time. 

To conclude my rapport, I designed a site that caters to the modern young family, kids today grow up and consume minimalist design everywhere they go, therefore I opted for a minimalist almost retro futuristic look for the site, the introduction of colour mainly coming from the pictures I use, I like this design, and so do my peer group age wise, it reflects in everything young adults and their young families consume today, had I designed this site only ten years ago I would have included a lot more colours.

To summarize this project, I will say that I set out with a very clear goal, and that was to improve on everything I did wrong the last time, nearly all of the code is written by me, I have borrowed a few lines, but not to the extent I did last time, this has resulted in perhaps too safe a site, but at least it works as intended, I know what I must work on and in the future I will be moving more out of my comfort zone.
